Gravity OAuth
=============

Getting Started
---------------

Go to [developer.gravity.com/register](http://developer.gravity.com/register)
to register your application.

The callback URL should point to this file, e.g. http://example.com/oauth.php.

Open oauth.php and set $clientId, $clientSecret and $callbackURL to the
appropriate values.

Upload the oauth.php and visit the callback URL in your browser. It should
redirect to the Gravity OAuth page. After authorization you should see your
user info displayed.
